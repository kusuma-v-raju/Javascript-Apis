    <!-- 
        - Fetch multiple Star Wars characters from the following enpoint: https://swapi.dev/api/people/
        - display a list of all the characters' name you fetched from the API
        - when clicking on each name, we would like to display more information about the character that we just clicked on (like mass, height, etc)

        (don't focus too much on the design, you could have two containers, one for the list of characters, one for a character details)
        Hints: 
        - you need a fetch() or XHR
        - you need a foreach
        - you need to create X elements for each name
        - you need to listen for clicks on each name
        - you need to display more info after clicking on a name
        - you need to clear the details before displaying details from another character

        <div id="details"> </div>
